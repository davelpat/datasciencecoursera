Summary Feature Selection
=========================

The variables from the UCI HAR data set selected for summary include all variables in the data set that have already summarized the raw instrument measurements and identified as mean, std (standard deviation) or meanFreq. The base variables include:

tBodyAcc
tGravityAcc
tBodyAccJerk
tBodyGyro
tBodyGyroJerk
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc
fBodyAccJerk
fBodyGyro
fBodyAccMag
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyBodyGyroMag
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag

These base variables, summarized and taken along X, Y, and Z directions, expand to the 79 variables in the project data set. The summary variables are named according to this pattern:

	mean.<raw base variable name>.<measure><.axial direction>

where:

	mean is the summary operation preformed on the raw data variables
	<raw base variable name> is one of the base variables from the list above
	<measure> is one of mean, std or meanFreq
	<.axial direction> is one of .X, .Y, or .Z, if the raw data variable had an axial direction

See summarized_features.txt for the full list of summary variables and how they map to the raw data variables. See features_info.txt for more details on the raw data variables.
